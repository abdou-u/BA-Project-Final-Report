This project explores the simulation of infectious processes on networks, focusing on the identification of infection sources within grids then graph-based models. We first go through the implementation of some grid-based algorithms and then their comparison using different criteria, then we move to networks and we compare our algorithms outcomes to other literature's results. Although in a grid-based homogeneous infection, it would be a lot easier to find the source of the infection, results indicate that certain network structures enhance the traceability of the infection origin, offering potential strategies for effective disease monitoring and control. This project contributes to our understanding of infections' spread, and how would the model affect the source detection of the infection.
