This thesis explores the simulation of infectious processes on networks, focusing on the identification of infection sources within graph-based models. Utilizing a combination of probabilistic models and network theory, this study examines the dynamics of infectious spread in both synthetic and real-world networks. By implementing algorithms like the Reverse Infection Algorithm, significant insights were gained into the source detection efficacy across various network topologies. Results indicate that certain network structures enhance the traceability of the infection origin, offering potential strategies for effective disease monitoring and control. This research contributes to our understanding of epidemiological frameworks and proposes new avenues for enhancing disease surveillance systems.
