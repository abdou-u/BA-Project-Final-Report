This project investigates the spread of infectious diseases on multiple network structures, with a dual focus on grid-based and graph-based models. At first, we implement and analyze various grid-based algorithms, then assess their performance based on specified criteria. Afterwards, we extend our analysis to more complex network models. We also analyze the differential equations for grid-based and network-based infections and access the reproduction number and the growth rate that determine if the infection dies out. We then explore some Stochastic and Probabilistic Approach using  stochastic differential equations (SDEs). And we use Gillespie Algorithm to simulate our theoretical work.\\
Our results reveal that while homogeneous grid-based models simplify the identification of infection sources, certain complex network structures significantly enhance the traceability of these origins which offers promising strategies for more effective disease monitoring and control. Through this study, we contribute to the understanding of disease spread dynamics and the impact of network models on the detectability of infection sources.
